## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Munasir Pv**, a **Senior Flutter Developer** and **Team Lead** based in Kerala, India. 

I have been working in the IT industry since **2015**, starting my career as a **Java Developer (Hibernate)** before finding my passion in cross-platform mobile engineering. This strong backend foundation allows me to design better data layers and API integrations in mobile apps.

* **Current Focus:** Building production-ready Flutter applications and leading development teams.
* **Engineering Philosophy:** I focus on writing **maintainable code**, robust **State Management** (Rivepod/Provider), and leveraging modern **AI workflows** (Cursor, Copilot) to boost developer velocity.
* **Beyond Code:** I am currently exploring **GraphQL** integrations and building a personal health-tech project called *Family Health Vault*.
